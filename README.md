[![API documentation](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera.cloud/actions/workflows/publish_docs.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera.cloud/actions/workflows/publish_docs.yml)

`cloudera.cloud` is an Ansible collection that lets you manage your **[Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-data-platform.html) Public Cloud** resources. With this collection, you can:

* Create and manage [Datalakes](https://www.cloudera.com/products/open-data-lakehouse.html) and Environments.
* Manage Users and Groups.
* Create and manage [Data Hubs](https://www.cloudera.com/products/data-hub.html) and Data Services, such as:
  * [Cloudera Data Flow (CDF)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/dataflow.html)
  * [Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/data-engineering.html)
  * [Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/data-warehouse.html)
  * [Cloudera Machine Learning (CML)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/machine-learning.html)
  * [Cloudera Operational Database](https://www.cloudera.com/products/operational-db.html)
  * [Cloudera Stream Processing (CSP)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/stream-processing.html)

## Installation

To install the `cloudera.cloud` collection, you have several options. Please note that we have not yet published this collection to the public Ansible Galaxy server, so you cannot install it via direct namespace, rather you must specify by Git project and (optionally) branch.

### Option #1: Install from GitHub

Create or edit your `requirements.yml` file in your project with the
following:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera.cloud.git
    type: git
    version: main
```

And then run in your project:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

You can also install the collection directly:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera.cloud.git@main
```

### Option #2: Install the tarball

Periodically, the collection is packaged into a distribution which you can
install directly:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install <collection-tarball>
```

See [Building the Collection](#building-the-collection) for details on creating a local tarball.

## Requirements

`cloudera.cloud` expects `ansible-core>=2.10`.

The collection also requires the following Python libraries install to operate its modules:

  * [`cdpy`](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cdpy)

The collection's Python dependencies alone, _not_ the required Python libraries of its collection dependencies, are in `requirements.txt`.

`ansible-builder` can discover and install all Python dependencies - current collection and dependencies - if you wish to use that application to construct your environment. Otherwise, you will need to read each collection and role dependency and follow its installation instructions.

See the [Collection Metadata](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/builder/en/latest/collection_metadata/) section for further details on how to install (and manage) collection dependencies.

You may wish to use a _virtual environment_ to manage the Python dependencies.

## Using the Collection

Once installed, reference the collection in your playbooks and roles.

For example, here we use the
[`cloudera.cloud.env_info` module](https://cloudera-labs.github.io/cloudera.cloud/env_info_module.html) to list all available CDP environments:

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: List all CDP environments
      cloudera.cloud.env_info:
      register: output

    - name: Display the resulting JSON
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: output
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The CDP modules expect standard CDP authentication configurations, e.g. `CDP_PROFILE`, as described by the *Configuring* section of [CDP CLI/SDK](https://github.com/cloudera/cdpcli#configuring).

## Building the Collection

To create a local collection tarball, run:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection build
```

## Building the API Documentation

To create a local copy of the API documentation, first make sure the collection is in your `ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS`. Then run the following:

```bash
# change into the /docsbuild directory
cd docsbuild

# install the build requirements (antsibull-docs); you may want to set up a
# dedicated virtual environment
pip install ansible-core https://github.com/cloudera-labs/antsibull-docs/archive/cldr-docsite.tar.gz

# Install the collection's build dependencies
pip install requirements.txt

# Then run the build script
./build.sh
```

Your local documentation will be found at `docsbuild/build/html`.
