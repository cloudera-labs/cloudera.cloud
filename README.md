[![API documentation](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera.cloud/actions/workflows/publish_docs.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera.cloud/actions/workflows/publish_docs.yml)

`cloudera.cloud` is an Ansible collection that lets you manage your **[Cloudera Platform](https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-data-platform.html) on cloud (Public Cloud)** resources. With this collection, you can:

* Create and manage [Datalakes](https://www.cloudera.com/products/open-data-lakehouse.html) and Environments.
* Manage Users and Groups.
* Create and manage [Data Hubs](https://www.cloudera.com/products/data-hub.html) and Data Services, such as:
  * [Cloudera Data Flow (CDF)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/dataflow.html)
  * [Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/data-engineering.html)
  * [Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/data-warehouse.html)
  * [Cloudera Machine Learning (CML)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/machine-learning.html)
  * [Cloudera Operational Database](https://www.cloudera.com/products/operational-db.html)
  * [Cloudera Stream Processing (CSP)](https://www.cloudera.com/products/stream-processing.html)

## Contribute

For more information on how to get involved with the `cloudera.cloud` Ansible collection, head over to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation

To install the `cloudera.cloud` collection, you have several options.

The preferred method is to install via Ansible Galaxy; in your `requirements.yml` file, add the following:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: cloudera.cloud
```

If you want to install from GitHub, add to your `requirements.yml` file the following:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera.cloud.git
    type: git
    version: main
```

And then run in your project:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

You can also install the collection directly:

```bash
# From Ansible Galaxy
ansible-galaxy collection install cloudera.cloud
```

```bash
# From GitHub
ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera.cloud.git@main
```

`ansible-builder` can discover and install all Python dependencies - current collection and dependencies - if you wish to use that application to construct your environment. Otherwise, you will need to read each collection and role dependency and follow its installation instructions.

See the [Collection Metadata](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/builder/en/latest/collection_metadata/) section for further details on how to install (and manage) collection dependencies.

You may wish to use a _virtual environment_ to manage the Python dependencies.

## Using the Collection

Once installed, reference the collection in your playbooks and roles.

For example, here we use the
[`cloudera.cloud.env_info` module](https://cloudera-labs.github.io/cloudera.cloud/env_info_module.html) to list all available CDP environments:

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: List all CDP environments
      cloudera.cloud.env_info:
      register: output

    - name: Display the resulting JSON
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: output
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The collection expects standard Cloudera Platform authentication configurations, e.g. `CDP_PROFILE`, as described by the *Configuring* section of [CDP CLI/SDK](https://github.com/cloudera/cdpcli#configuring).

## Building the API Documentation

To create a local copy of the API documentation, first make sure the collection is in your `ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH`.

```bash
hatch run docs:build
```

Your local documentation will be found at `docsbuild/build/html`.

You can also lint the documentation with the following command:

```bash
hatch run docs:lint
```

## Preparing a New Version

To prepare a version release, first set the following variables for `antsichaut`:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=some_gh_token_value # Read-only scope
```

Update the collection version using [`hatch version`](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/version/). For example, to increment to the next _minor_ release:

```bash
hatch version minor
```

Then update the changelog to query the pull requests since the last release.

```bash
hatch run docs:changelog
```

You can then examine (and update if needed) the resulting `changelog.yaml` and `CHANGELOG.rst` files before committing to the release branch.
