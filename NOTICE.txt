OVERVIEW
Items appearing in the following notices are provided for the notification and
guidance of the recipient in accordance with the listed license.  The listing
may include various dependencies applicable only to development, testing, and
evaluation, which may not be included in the distribution and may have been
deprecated in favor of alternatives.  Accordingly, this listing should not be
construed as an admission that the listed component appears in the distribution
nor in the manner indicated.  Similarly, fulfilling a license’s compliance
requirements for a particular form of distribution is not an admission that the
software is in fact distributed in that form.  Distributions and packaging vary
and not all third party components are relied upon in the same manner or degree.
In addition, some compliance documentation, such as embedded notices files in
source code, may be found within the distribution itself rather than below.
“Third Party Software” and “Separately Licensed Code” as defined in the
applicable Cloudera or Hortonworks agreement, respectively, have the same
meaning for the purposes of this notice.

MOST PERMISSIVE LICENSE APPLIES TO THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE
Where the Third Party Software contains dual or multiple licensing options, the
most permissive license compatible with your Cloudera software license applies.

CONTAINERIZED OPERATING SYSTEM
The Cloudera software runs on certain operating systems, such as the Linux
operating system, which may be delivered to you with a containerized
installation of the operating system for your convenience. Cloudera software
constitutes a separate and independent work from the operating system, and the
provided container is an aggregation of the operating system and the Cloudera
software.

NO WARRANTY; NO LIABILITY; NO INDEMNIFICATION/HOLD HARMLESS
Notwithstanding any agreement recipient may have with Cloudera: (A) CLOUDERA
PROVIDES THRID PARTY SOFTWARE TO RECIPIENT WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND; (B)
CLOUDERA DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO
THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE,

CLOUDERA IS NOT LIABLE TO RECIPIENT, AND WILL NOT DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, NOR HOLD
RECIPIENT HARMLESS FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIRD PARTY
SOFTWARE; AND (D) WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, CLOUDERA IS NOT
LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES RELATED TO LOST
REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF INCOME, LOSS OF BUSINESS ADVANTAGE OR
UNAVAILABILITY, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA.

Further, to the extent Cloudera delivers a containerized installation of an
operating system, such operating system contains open source software
constituting Third Party Software, including software licensed under the GNU
General Public License (GPL).  Such Third Party Software may or may not be
identified separately in the notices below.  To the extent required by the GPL
